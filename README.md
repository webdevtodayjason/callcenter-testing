  <p><i>A powerful tool for testing call center systems with realistic voice simulations</i></p>
</div>

A Flask-based web application for testing call center systems using Twilio's voice API. This tool allows you to make test calls to phone numbers with customizable audio playback options.

## ‚ú® Features

### üìû Multiple Call Management
- **Simultaneous Calls**: Make calls to multiple phone numbers with configurable delay between calls
- **Load Control**: Set the maximum number of simultaneous calls to control system load
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor each call's status in real-time

### üîä Customizable Audio Playback
- **Text-to-Speech Only**: Use Twilio's TTS or Eleven Labs for voice synthesis
- **Text-to-Speech + MP3**: Play a custom greeting followed by an MP3 file
- **MP3 Only**: Play only an MP3 file during the call

### üó£Ô∏è Enhanced Text-to-Speech with Eleven Labs
- **Natural-Sounding Voices**: High-quality, realistic voice synthesis
- **Multiple Voice Options**: Choose from various voice profiles with adjustable settings
- **Direct API Integration**: Seamless integration with Eleven Labs API
- **Performance Optimization**: Audio caching to improve responsiveness

### üìÇ MP3 File Management
- **Easy Upload**: Upload MP3 files through the intuitive web interface
- **File Operations**: Delete or rename existing MP3 files
- **Preview Capability**: Listen to MP3 files before using them in calls

### üìä Real-time Call Status Updates
- **Live Monitoring**: Track call progress with Socket.IO
- **Detailed Logging**: View comprehensive logs for troubleshooting
- **Call Control**: Abort ongoing calls when needed

### üß™ Test Pages
- Dedicated pages for testing MP3 playback, static file serving, and Twilio integration

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webdevtodayjason/callcenter-testing.git
   cd callcenter-testing
   ```

2. Create and activate a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n callcenter python=3.11
   conda activate callcenter
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Edit the `.env` file with your Twilio credentials and other configuration options.

## üìã Usage

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5005`

3. Configure your call settings:
   - Enter phone numbers (one per line) in E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567)
   - Set the delay between calls (minimum 1 second)
   - Set the maximum number of simultaneous calls (1-50)
   - Choose playback mode (Text-to-Speech Only, Text-to-Speech + MP3, or MP3 Only)
   - Select MP3 options (random or specific file)
   - Configure Text-to-Speech settings

4. Click "Start Calls" to initiate the calls

5. Monitor call status in real-time on the page

## üéµ MP3 Management

The application provides a dedicated page for managing MP3 files:

1. Navigate to the "Manage MP3 Files" page from the main interface
2. Upload new MP3 files (up to 16MB)
3. Preview existing MP3 files
4. Rename or delete MP3 files as needed

## üîä Eleven Labs Integration

The application features full integration with Eleven Labs for enhanced text-to-speech:

1. Sign up for an Eleven Labs account at [https://elevenlabs.io](https://elevenlabs.io)
2. Get your API key from the Eleven Labs dashboard
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file
4. Configure your voice IDs in the `ELEVENLABS_VOICES` environment variable
5. Select "Eleven Labs" as your TTS provider in the web interface
6. Choose from available voices and customize settings as needed

**Benefits of using Eleven Labs:**
- Higher quality, more natural-sounding voices compared to Twilio's built-in TTS
- Multiple voice options to choose from
- Ability to save generated audio for reuse

## üíª Development

### Local Testing with ngrok

For testing callbacks locally:

1. Install ngrok: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)
2. Start ngrok on port 5005:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5005
   ```
3. Update the `BASE_URL` in your `.env` file with the ngrok URL

### Test Pages

The application includes several test pages to verify functionality:

- `/test-mp3`: Test MP3 file playback
- `/test-static`: Test static file serving
- `/test-twilio`: Test Twilio account integration
- `/test-call`: Test TwiML response
